# VMS-datacall

[This R-script](https://github.com/ICES-dk/VMS-datacall/blob/master/VMSdatacall_2017_proposedWorkflow.r "Data Workflow") has been developed in collaboration with the ICES working group [WGSFD](http://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGSFD.aspx "Working Group on Spatial Fisheries Data") to aid technical personnel of countries in successfully submitting data to comply with the   [2017 ICES Data call](http://ices.dk/marine-data/Documents/Data_calls/VMS.datacall.2017-Final.pdf) for VMS/Log book data for fishing activities in the North East Atlantic and Baltic Sea.

The script has been, and is being developed, as a community driven initiative to help guide data submitters in an iterative way to meet the ICES VMS/Log book data call.
